# ARM7TDMI-PROGRAMMING

<hr>
<h3>Contains the programs for the ARM-7 Weekly Assignments</h3>

<h4>If any corrections required,  open a issue and We will address it ASAP.</h4>
The <em><strong><u>Programs folder</u></strong></em> is created since we are not sure of which program statement is given for which week , hence (maybe) from now onwards we will be pushing all progs here
